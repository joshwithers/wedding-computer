# CLAUDE.md — Wedding Computer

> A multi-party wedding collaboration platform. Closed source. Built on Cloudflare Workers. Your data lives as plain-text markdown.

## Project Overview

Wedding Computer is a SaaS platform for the wedding industry. Vendors manage leads, contacts, calendars, and invoicing; couples track their vendors and wedding details; everyone coordinates on a shared wedding entity.

**Live URL:** `wedding.computer` (also `www.wedding.computer`)
**Local dev:** `localhost:8787` (`npm run dev`)

### Licensing & positioning

The project is **closed source** (private repo, proprietary). Do **not** describe it as open source, AGPL, or licensed for reuse — in code comments, docs, or marketing copy. The openness story is **open data**: every vendor's data is a folder of plain markdown files they can read, sync, and take with them (see the open standard at `wedding.computer/standard`).

### Pricing

The core product is **free forever** (not "early access", not a trial). A paid Pro subscription gates power features: device sync (CalDAV/CardDAV), the vault sync API, the JSON intake API, and the MCP server.

### Sibling projects (don't break these)

- **Obsidian plugin** — `github.com/joshwithers/wedding-computer-sync`, separate repo, live in the Obsidian community directory. Talks to this app's vault API (`src/routes/vault-api.ts`), authenticated with the per-vendor sync token.
- **Wedding Institute** — Astro site at `~/Websites/wedding-institute` that consumes this app's public directory API (`/api/directory/*`, served by `src/routes/public/directory.tsx`). Don't change those response shapes without updating that site.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Wrangler CLI v4

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run db:schema:local     # Apply full schema.sql to local D1 (fresh setup)
npm run db:migrate:local    # Or apply numbered migrations (existing DB)
npm run db:seed:local       # Seed demo data
npm run dev                 # Builds CSS, starts wrangler dev at localhost:8787
npm run typecheck           # tsc --noEmit
npm test                    # Vitest
```

**Local login bypass:** set `ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN=true` in `.dev.vars`, then visit `/dev/login/:email` to mint a session for any email. The route 404s unless the var is exactly `'true'` — never set it in deployed environments.

### Secrets

Set via `wrangler secret put <NAME>` (full list = `Bindings` in [src/types.ts](src/types.ts)):

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Session cookie signing |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Transactional email |
| `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Svix signature for `POST /webhooks/resend` (bounce suppression) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI features (optional — vendors can bring their own key) |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API (platform account) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Signing secret — dashboard endpoint for platform-account events (subscriptions) |
| `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Signing secret — dashboard endpoint for Connected-account events (onboarding, payments); both deliver to `/webhooks/stripe` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth |
| `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` / `APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Apple Sign-In |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | CAPTCHA verification |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Geocoding (optional) |
| `SIGNUP_INVITE_CODE` | When set, public self-signup requires this code |
| `ENABLE_DEV_LOGIN` | Local only — see above |

Public vars (in `wrangler.toml`): `APP_URL`, `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`.
Bindings: `DB` (D1), `KV`, `STORAGE` (R2), `EMAIL_QUEUE`, `AI` (Workers AI), `SEND_EMAIL`.

## Data Model

**`schema.sql` is the source of truth** — read it (and `src/types.ts`) rather than trusting any doc, including this one. It currently defines ~39 tables: the core CRM/wedding entities plus emails, forms, quotes, contracts, run sheets, todos, team members, import jobs, subscriptions, referrals, analytics, busyness/demand scoring, file index/conflicts, waitlist, broadcasts, and more.

Schema conventions:

- IDs: `TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(12))))` (24 hex chars)
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 strings via `datetime('now')`; booleans: `INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
- JSON columns: `TEXT`, parsed at the application layer
- Every tenant-scoped table has explicit ownership columns
- Schema changes = a new numbered file in `migrations/` **and** the same change applied to `schema.sql`

### The wedding entity

A **wedding** is the central object. Users join it via `wedding_members`:

- `role` is one of `'vendor' | 'couple' | 'guest'` — there is **no `'owner'` role** (removed in migration 015). Management rights come from the `can_manage` flag; the creator is recorded in `weddings.created_by_user_id`.
- `is_financial_party` marks who payments flow through (e.g. an organiser venue/planner with `vendor_profiles.is_organiser = 1`).
- Vendors are linked via `vendor_profile_id` + `vendor_role` (their service).
- Lifecycle: CRM contact (`new → contacted → … → booked`) is promoted to a wedding; the couple is invited by email; other vendors join with `role='vendor'`.

### Markdown first, D1 as index

Vendor data is stored as **markdown files with YAML frontmatter** in a pluggable storage backend (`src/storage/`): R2 by default, or the vendor's own GitHub repo (`storage_type='git'`). D1 holds a queryable index of the same data (`file_index`, `file_conflicts` track sync state).

Each wedding is a folder of companion files: `wedding.md` (details + shared notes), `todo.md` (checklist), `timeline.md` (run sheet — own rows two-way, other vendors' rows and pending approvals generated), `notes.md` (the vendor's private notes), `vendors.md` (wedding team — generated, read-only), `log.md` (changelog — generated, read-only), plus `files/` uploads. Contacts are flat files under `contacts/`.

- Writes from the web app go through the storage backend and D1 together.
- External edits (Obsidian, GitHub, vault API) are ingested into D1 — immediately for vault-API writes, otherwise by the background sync sweep (every 5 minutes, one shard of vendors is enqueued).
- **File edits obey app permissions** (`src/services/timeline-edit.ts`): timeline-field changes in `wedding.md` from a non-controlling vendor become `timeline_change_requests` (planner/venue approval) instead of direct writes, and couple-only fields (`vendor_visibility`) are protected. The same routing backs the MCP write tools.
- Conflicts are etag-detected (`If-Match`), never silently overwritten: both versions are kept and a `file_conflicts` row is recorded. `StorageConflictError` is handled globally in `index.tsx`.

---

## External Interfaces

Stable surfaces with outside consumers — change shapes carefully:

| Surface | Route file | Consumer / auth |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| `/api/directory/*` | `routes/public/directory.tsx` | Wedding Institute site (public) |
| `/vault/v1/*` | `routes/vault-api.ts` | Obsidian plugin (bearer sync token, Pro) |
| `POST /mcp` | `routes/mcp.ts` | MCP clients (bearer sync token, Pro) |
| `POST /api/v1/enquiries` | `routes/api.ts` | Zapier/webhooks/agents (bearer enquiry key, Pro) |
| `/cal/:token`, `/caldav`, `/carddav` | `routes/feed.ts`, `caldav.ts`, `carddav.ts` | Calendar/contacts apps |
| `/webhooks/*`, Stripe webhooks | `routes/webhooks.ts`, `stripe.ts` | Resend, Stripe (signature-verified) |
| `/.well-known/*` | `index.tsx` | Agent/MCP/OAuth discovery |

---

## Authentication

No passwords. Two ways in:

1. **Magic links** (primary): token in KV with 15-minute TTL, single-use, emailed via Resend.
2. **Passkeys** (WebAuthn): `services/webauthn.ts`, `passkey_credentials` table.

> Google/Apple OAuth bindings exist in `types.ts` but are not yet implemented — do not describe social sign-in as available.

Sessions: random token in KV (30-day rolling TTL) + D1 `sessions` row for revocation, `wc_session` cookie (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax). New session ID on every login.

---

## Multi-Tenancy

Shared D1 database with strict application-layer isolation:

1. **`requireAuth`** (`middleware/auth.ts`): validates session, loads `user`, applies their locale/timezone to the i18n context.
2. **`requireVendor`** (`middleware/tenant.ts`): loads `vendor` for `/app/*` routes; redirects couples to their wedding and new users to onboarding.
3. **Data access layer** (`db/*.ts`, `storage/*.ts`): every function takes a scoping ID as a required parameter. No unscoped queries exist.

Each vendor route file mounts its own guard chain:

```typescript
dashboard.use('/app', requireAuth, csrf, requireVendor)
dashboard.use('/app/*', requireAuth, csrf, requireVendor)
```

```typescript
// CORRECT: always scoped
export async function listContacts(db: D1Database, vendorId: string): Promise<Contact[]> { … }

// NEVER: unscoped
export async function listAllContacts(db: D1Database) { /* FORBIDDEN */ }
```

Admin routes use `requireAdmin` (404, not 403, for non-admins). Sensitive operations call `auditLog()` (`middleware/audit.ts`) into the `audit_log` table.

---

## Payments

Stripe **Connect Standard**: each vendor connects their own Stripe account; invoices are created on the connected account (`Stripe-Account` header); webhooks update local status. Invoices also support non-Stripe records (`bank_transfer`, `payid`, historical imports) — see `invoices` + `invoice_payments` tables. Organiser vendors (`is_financial_party`) can route a wedding's billing through their account.

Subscriptions (Pro) live in the `subscriptions` table with referral rewards (`referrals`, `free_month_grants`) handled by `services/free-months.ts`.

---

## Background Work

All in `src/index.tsx`'s default export:

- **`queue()`** — consumer for `wedding-computer-emails` (magic links, notifications, digests, storage-sync jobs). Failures retry up to 3× then land in the `wedding-computer-emails-dlq` dead-letter queue.
- **`email()`** — inbound email via Cloudflare Email Routing (`services/inbound-email.ts`).
- **`scheduled()`** — two crons: `0 20 * * *` (daily vendor digests, ~6am AEST) and `*/5 * * * *` (storage sync, one vendor shard per tick).

Code running outside a request gets platform-default i18n — wrap recipient-facing work in `runWithI18n()` (see below).

---

## Conventions

### Code Style
- Explicit `return` in route handlers
- DB functions: first param `db: D1Database`, second param the scoping ID
- Storage-backed entities: get the backend via `getStorageWithSecrets(c.env, vendor)` and use `src/storage/` functions, not raw R2
- Error responses: `{ error: string }` with HTTP status; HTML via `c.html(<Component />)`
- Global `app.onError()`; never expose stack traces; structured logs via `lib/log.ts`

### Naming
- DB tables: `snake_case` plural · TypeScript types: `PascalCase` singular
- Route files: `kebab-case.ts(x)` · DB functions: `verbNoun` (`listContacts`, `getContact`)

### Internationalisation (REQUIRED for all new/edited UI)

The platform is multilingual/multi-timezone by design. Every request runs in
an AsyncLocalStorage i18n context (`src/i18n`) carrying the viewer's locale,
language, and timezone — resolved from `users.locale`/`users.timezone`, then
the vendor's timezone, then Accept-Language, then defaults (en-AU,
Australia/Sydney).

- **User-facing strings**: never hardcode. Add a key to `src/i18n/en.ts`
  (dot-namespaced: `contacts.title`, assembled from fragments in `src/i18n/en/`)
  and render with `t('key')` / `t('key', { name })`. Plurals: `.one`/`.other`
  key pairs via `tp(base, count)`. `t()` works in any component or service —
  no prop-drilling.
- **Dates/times**: always through `src/lib/date.ts` (`formatDate`,
  `formatDateTime`, `formatDayLabel`, `monthLabel`, `todayString`). Never call
  `toLocaleDateString`/`toLocaleString` with a hardcoded locale or timezone in
  routes. `todayString()` is the viewer's "today", not the server's.
- **Adding a language**: create `src/i18n/<lang>.ts` satisfying `Dictionary`,
  register it in `DICTIONARIES`, add regional tags to `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`.
  Untranslated keys fall back to English at runtime. Current languages:
  de, el, en, es, fr, it, ja, nl, pt, zh.
- **Jobs/cron/email**: code outside a request gets platform defaults; wrap in
  `runWithI18n({ locale, timezone }, fn)` with the recipient's preferences.

### Security checklist (steady state)

- CSRF token on all state-changing requests (bound to session)
- Every query scoped by vendor/user/wedding; no admin endpoints that bypass scoping
- Rate limiting + auth-failure throttling on public and token-auth endpoints
- Turnstile on public forms; MIME/size validation on uploads
- R2 access via the storage layer / signed flows, never public bucket access
- Audit log for logins, exports, deletions, invitations, payments
- Account deletion = soft delete then purge (see `services/account.ts`, RECOVERY.md)
- Secrets via `wrangler secret` only; no PII in URLs; no tracking cookies
